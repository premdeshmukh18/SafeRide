# SafeRide
By utilising technology to identify potential safety hazards, the innovative project Saferide seeks to increase rider safety. Saferide promotes safe riding practises and reduces the risk of accidents and injuries by monitoring if a rider is wearing a helmet and if they are under the influence of alcohol. With more vehicles on the road and an increase in accidents and fatalities, there is a growing need for solutions that promote safe transportation practises. Saferide meets this need by employing sensors to detect possible safety hazards and inform riders and drivers when needed. Saferide has the ability to drastically minimise the risks connected with riding and make the roads safer.
